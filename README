Welcome to the repo.

You can find the main code for the bot in bot.py file. Almost every line is commented, so you can easily understand how
it works.

Prior to uploading it on Github I hided my bot API key.

To run this our your machine you have to create a file called .env in the same folder (directory) as
the project and paste your bot API key inside in the following form:

TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN='your actual API key'
