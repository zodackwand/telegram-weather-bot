Welcome to the repo.

You can find the main code for the bot in the bot.py file. Almost every line is commented on, so you can easily understand how it works.

Before uploading it on Github, I hid my bot API key.

To run this on your machine you have to create a file called .env in the same folder (directory) as
the project and paste your bot API key inside in the following form:

TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN='your actual API key'
